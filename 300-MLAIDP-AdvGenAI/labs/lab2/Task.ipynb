    "# Task 2: Use Amazon Bedrock for Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learn how to use the Bedrock Nova Lite model to provide information responses to queries by sending the request with the full relevant context to the model and expecting the response back, addressing the challenge of having the model return factual answers for questions without needing to prepare and index documents beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook simulates what **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** would do, but not actually using RAG. This approach works with short documents or single-ton applications; it might not scale to enterprise-level question answering where large enterprise documents cannot all be fit into the prompt sent to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question Answering (QA)** is an important task that involves extracting answers to factual queries posed in natural language. Typically, a QA system processes a query against a knowledge base containing structured or unstructured data and generates a response with accurate information. Ensuring high accuracy is key to developing a useful, reliable, and trustworthy question answering system, especially for enterprise use cases."

    "\n",
    "You try modeling a situation at AnyCompany where you ask a question answering model to provide information about changing tires for a specific vehicle model they manufacture. You first query the model using a \"zero shot\" approach to see if it can provide relevant answers based just on its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you realize the model seems to be \"hallucinating\" more generic answers, as evidenced when you try a fake vehicle model and get similar responses. This implies the need to augment the model's training with Example Company's actual vehicle manuals to give specifics on tires for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you simulate such a \"Retrieval Augmented Generation\" (RAG) approach without external data. You provide a detailed manual excerpt explaining how to change the tires on the AnyCompany Model Z vehicle. You test if the model can now give a customized, accurate answer leveraging this in-context example content."
